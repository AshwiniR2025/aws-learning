# Day 1: AWS Fundamentals & Core Skills

## Goal (Day 1)
Build a strong foundation in AWS core services and the basic workflow expected from a data engineering intern:
- Understand key AWS services and what they’re used for
- Set up IAM safely (non-root usage, roles)
- Set up S3 properly (naming, uploads, versioning)
- Learn GitHub workflow (repo, branch, PR mindset)

---

## 1) AWS Core Services (high-level understanding)

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)
**What it is:** AWS permissions and access control.  
**Key concepts:**
- **Root user:** account owner; should not be used daily.
- **IAM users:** identities for people/systems (avoid long-lived access keys when possible).
- **Groups:** attach policies once and manage users cleanly.
- **Roles:** temporary credentials assumed by services (Lambda/EC2/Glue) or users (Switch Role).
- **Policies:** define permissions (Action + Resource). Default is deny; explicit deny overrides allow.

**Best practices learned:**
- Use least privilege
- Prefer roles over access keys for services
- Keep S3 private by default

### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
**What it is:** Object storage for files (CSV, Parquet, images, logs).  
**Key concepts:**
- **Bucket** (container) → globally unique name
- **Object** (file)
- **Key/prefix** (path-like name such as `raw/…`)
- Versioning supports rollback of overwritten files

### Lambda
**What it is:** Serverless compute. Runs code without managing servers.  
**Common use:** Trigger on S3 upload, run transformations, validations, notifications.  
**Key dependency:** needs an IAM **execution role** to access other services like S3.

### CloudWatch
**What it is:** Monitoring and logging.  
**Common use:** Lambda logs and metrics, alarms (CPU, errors, etc.).

### CloudTrail
**What it is:** Audit logs of AWS API actions.  
**Common use:** Track “who did what” (security investigations, compliance).

### AWS Glue
**What it is:** Serverless ETL for data engineering.  
**Common use:** Read raw data from S3, transform, write curated data back to S3.  
**Key dependency:** Glue runs with an IAM role (service role).

### RDS (PostgreSQL)
**What it is:** Managed relational database (Postgres).  
**Common use:** store structured data for applications and analytics; connect from ETL jobs.

## 2) Security & Compliance (Day 1 level)
- Keep **Block Public Access** ON for S3 buckets
- Use IAM groups and least privilege policies
- Roles + temporary credentials reduce risk (no hardcoded keys)
- CloudTrail is essential for auditing changes

---

## 3) Setup: IAM + Billing Alerts
### IAM setup completed
- Created **IAM user** for daily work (instead of root)
- Created **IAM group** to manage permissions
- Created **IAM role** for Lambda (service role pattern)

### Billing alerts (recommended)
- Set a monthly **Budget** with alerts (ex: 50%, 80%, 100%)
- Keep an eye on “always-on” resources (EC2, NAT Gateway, large S3 storage)

---

## 4) Hands-on: S3 Bucket + Uploads + Versioning

### Bucket created
- Bucket: `oubt-demo-s3`
- Block Public Access: ON
- Default encryption: Enabled
- Versioning: Enabled

### Folder/prefix structure
- `raw/` for incoming/source files

### Files uploaded (different file types)
- CSV: `taxi_zone_lookup.csv`
- Parquet: `yellow_tripdata_2025-08.parquet`
- TXT: `sample_log.txt`
- JPG: `sample_image.jpg`

### Versioning learning
- Versioning creates a new version when the **same object key** is uploaded again.
- Versioning helps recover from accidental overwrite/delete.

---

## 5) Hands-on: IAM Users, Groups, Roles (Role-based access)
- IAM-Ashwini_Oubt with admistrative access attached with OUBT_Demo group 
- 

### Role created for Lambda
- Role: `LambdaS3Role`

**Trust policy (WHO can assume):**
- Trusted entity: Lambda (`lambda.amazonaws.com`)
- Action: `sts:AssumeRole`

**Permissions policies (WHAT it can do):**
- `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` (CloudWatch logging)
- Custom S3 policy for bucket `oubt-demo-s3`:
  - `s3:ListBucket` on `arn:aws:s3:::oubt-demo-s3`
  - `s3:GetObject` and `s3:PutObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::oubt-demo-s3/*`

### Validation
- Created a Lambda function, attached `LambdaS3Role`
- Ran a test successfully (S3 list objects worked)

**Conclusion:** trust policy + S3 permissions are working end-to-end.

---

## 6) GitHub Basics (Repo setup + PR workflow)

### Repo setup completed
- Created repo: `aws-learning`
- Cloned locally and verified clean working tree
- Created branch: `docs/day1-notes`

### PR workflow (standard pattern)
1) Create a branch for your work
2) Add/update files
3) Commit changes
4) Push branch to GitHub
5) Open a PR to merge into `main`

---

## 7) Python + SQL + Data Modeling (Day 1 expectations)
> Day 1 focus is awareness + setup (not deep coding yet)

### Python for data engineering (what matters)
- Reading/writing files (CSV/JSON/Parquet)
- Basic transformations (filter, aggregate)
- Knowing that frameworks like Spark/Glue scale this later

### SQL for data engineering (what matters)
- SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY
- Aggregations and filters
- Thinking in tables and transformations

### Data modeling fundamentals
- Tables + keys + relationships
- Normalized vs analytics models (later: star schema)
- Data lake layers concept: raw → curated → gold

---

## Deliverables (what I completed today)
- S3 bucket created with correct security defaults + versioning
- Uploaded multiple file types (CSV, Parquet, TXT, JPG)
- IAM user + group created
- Lambda execution role created with least-privilege S3 access + CloudWatch logs
- Lambda test succeeded (role works)
- GitHub repo created + branch created for documentation
